collection ka kaam hai multiple data ko store karna

array --- it is homogenous in nature
array is fixed in size 


collection ---- it is hetrogenous in nature 
collection is dynamic in nature 

arrays --- it is a util class ---- so we do Arrays.sort();


like if we want to reverse a array..we have to do by writing manual method
but in the case of collection---- there are inbuild memthods



Collections ka parent method ----

-----------------------------🔷 Collection Interface Hierarchy Breakdown:--------------------------
                                       
                                                Collection (I)
                                                /     |      \
                                                /      |       \
                                            List     Set     Queue  ← interfaces ---- these three are also interface.....
                                            |        |        |
                                        ArrayList HashSet  LinkedList
                                        LinkedList LinkedHashSet PriorityQueue
                                        Vector     TreeSet   ArrayDeque
                                        Stack

                                        Note: Map is not part of Collection.

Collection is a Interface --- not class

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                                    -----------------🔸 1. Collection (Interface)
                                                    Root interface for most data structures in Java.    




                                    ---------------🔸 2. List (Interface)
                                                    Ordered, allows duplicates, indexed.

                                                    Class	Description
                                                    ArrayList	Resizable array, fast random access
                                                    LinkedList	Doubly linked list
                                                    Vector	Synchronized, legacy
                                                    Stack	LIFO stack, extends Vector




                                    ---------------🔸 3. Set (Interface)
                                                    Unordered, no duplicates.
                                                    Class	Description
                                                    HashSet	No order, uses hash table
                                                    LinkedHashSet	Maintains insertion order
                                                    TreeSet	Sorted set (uses TreeMap internally)


                                    ---------------🔸 4. Queue (Interface)
                                                    Follows FIFO or priority-based ordering.
                                                    Class	Description
                                                    LinkedList	Implements both List and Queue
                                                    PriorityQueue	Orders elements based on priority
                                                    ArrayDeque	Resizable-array implementation





                                                        🔸 Map (Separate Hierarchy — Not under Collection)

                                                                    ├── HashMap

-------------------------SYNCHRONIZATION AND MULTITHREADING-----------------

like when we want to give biryani to a dog..
like multiple dogs are there to eat biryani...

now the biryani is data and dogs are thread
so if multiple dogs are eating biryani..then the biryani is lost


THIS IS SIMILAR TO MULTITHREADING 
like if there is multithreading..then the data will get lost...

like if there are multiplethreads...then data will be lost..
and in order to preserve it... like feeding each dog one by one..
this is known as SYNCHRONIZATION


like if we want to save data..then we use SYNCHRONIZATION which will execute multiple thread one by one



memory threading --- multiple threads are executed at same time
synchornization --- multiple thread one by one 





-----------------------------ARRAYLIST ---------------------
                arraylist is a dynamic array 
                vector is a legacy collection 
                legacy colleciton --- when first hand java was introduced..... 1995 ----
                in the first version of java.... all the features was legacy 
                like vector was introduced in the first version of java.. so vector is a legacy collection 




arraylist --- like it has index
