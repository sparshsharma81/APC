throw keywoard --- it is used to throw custom exception 

like sout(10/0) --- arithmetic exception --- this is inbuild exception 
if we want to make our customized exception --- like not using build in exception 


like if the user has age less than 18 ---


new keywoard will create object 


class VotingAgeException extends RuntimeException {
    public VotingAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

// Main Class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 15;
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new VotingAgeException("You are not allowed to vote");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are allowed to vote");
        }
    }
}

like this ...it will throw custom made new exception 


throws basically method ko delicate kar deta hai..apne main method k paas...
