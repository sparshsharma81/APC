multithreading and synchhronisation 



synchhronisation
basically hamne 2 thread ek baari me chalahi ..aur hame 



like if we want to borrow money from bank..
then we can not withdraw it 


this is basically when one thread is not completed..next thread is not processed

  ️⃣1 What “multithreading” really means
Thread = a lightweight flow of control inside a program.

Multithreading lets several threads run as if they are doing work at the same time.

On a single‑core CPU they share the core by quickly taking turns (time‑slicing).

On a multi‑core CPU some threads can actually run in parallel.

Typical reasons to use threads


synchronized block
