The volatile keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable‚Äôs value may be changed by multiple threads 
and should always be read directly from main memory, not from a thread's local cache



VOLATILE ---- IT IS A KEYWORD WHICH IS REMOVED WITH VARIABLE 



if we want to make thread

üîç Why volatile is needed
In multithreaded programming, threads may cache variables for performance. 
Without volatile, a thread may not see the latest value of a shared variable updated by another thread.



for every thread there is os and whatever is in os..it will get stored to cache 
so for that we make it volatile 


when on one variable multiple threads execute --- then we get updated value everytime
//volatile is used so that it is not stored in cache
it is depricated --- it is not used now days
