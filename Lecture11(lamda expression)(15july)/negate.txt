🔁 negate() in Java (for functional interfaces)

In Java, negate() is a default method defined in some functional interfaces
 like Predicate<T> and IntPredicate. 
 
 
 It returns a new lambda that gives the opposite result of the original one.

 negate() ---this is a lamda function that gives opposite of the lamda function 

 Interf j = (int c)-> c%2 ==0;


 suppilier , consumer, predicate ---these are predefined lamda function
