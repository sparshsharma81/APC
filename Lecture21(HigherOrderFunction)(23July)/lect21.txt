method 

class Test{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        //like if there is 100 lines of code 
    }
}


method is block of statement and whenever we need that line of code..we will call that 

in method ..we can pass multiple inputs but we get only one output 


We can not define an method inside another method 



EXAMPLE 
public class MyClass {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        sayHello(); // calling the method
    }

    public static void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}



this one is incorrect 
public class MyClass {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Not allowed â€” you can't define a method inside another method
        public static void sayHello() {
            System.out.println("Hello");
            //incorrect 
        }
    }
}



ðŸ”¹ Function
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

It is independent and does not belong to a class or object.

Common in procedural languages like C, Python (at top level), etc.

ðŸ”¸ Example (C):


int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}


ðŸ”¹ Method
A method is a function defined inside a class.

It is associated with an object or class.

Common in OOP languages like Java, C++, C#, Python (within a class).

ðŸ”¸ Example (Java):

class MyClass {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}


//we can pass a function as a parameter inside a method..
but the parameter of the method should be a lamda function 


like the parameter of a method should be lamda expression
