plane object model -- POM

plane old java object -- POJO 

every framework has a bean class which do all the work by itself 

in spring frameowrk , all the classes must be a pojo classes, where the pojo class is a norma class.
it must not extend or implement predefined libraries, explicitly except java.io.Serializable maker interface .

by using the pojo classes in spring application, we are able to prepare all the components as less API dependent 
and light weight components.

2.in spring framwork , all bean classes must be public, not abstract, and not-final classes.
where the main purpose of the public is to bring bean classes scope to the spring framework in order to create bean objects.

in spring based application , spring framework has to create objects for the bean classes,  

in the source/main folder..we will create a resources folder
