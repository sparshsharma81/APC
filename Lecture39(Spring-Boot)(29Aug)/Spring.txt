Spring has a module called SpringBoot 
//in spring..we have to do manual work a lot..so we use spring-boot 



Spring Boot 

1.Purpose of Spring Boot 
Reduces the manual configuration required in traditional Spring. 
in Spring(without Boot), we had to:
Create XML configuration files
Manually configure all the files
Spring Boot 



Auto-Configurationn with dependencies
.when a dependency is added in the project, Spring Boot automatically configures it.
Example -- 
if we add Spring Data JPA, Boot 
-- Auto configures the JPA setup
-- Adds all required JAR files related to JPA and database handling 



Spring boot starter
