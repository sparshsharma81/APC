java says whenever we are making a collection..then we should define its generic 
like in case of arraylist..we should define integer

ArrayList<Integer>h1 = new ArrayList<>();


Collection 
it is an interface provided by JAVA along with JDK 1.2 version
it able to represent a group of individual elements as single unit 
it has provided the following methods common to every implementation class. 

Method 
1.Public boolean add(Object add)->This method is able to add the specified element to Collection object 

2.public boolean addAll(Collection c)-> this method can be used to add all the elements of specified Collection 
to the present Collection object.

3.public boolean remove(object obj)-> this method can be used to remove the specified element from the Collection object 

4.public boolean removeAll(Colleti)


add(object obj)
Collection1.add("Apple")



2. addAll(Collection c)
collection2.add("Banana");
Collection2.add("Dates");
Collection2.addAll(collection2);
sout("After addAll);



4.removeAll(Collection c)
collection1.removeAll(collection2);
System.out.println("after removeAll():" + collection1);

5.contains(Object obj)
System.out.println("Contains 'Apple'?" + collection1.contains("Apple"));
