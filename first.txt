ADVANCE PROGRAMMING CONCEPT 

in apc  --- we have spring-boot --- Advance programming concept
spring boot is used in backend 

now times ..60 - 70% projects are based on spring - boot 

datatype promotion --- method overriding 

we have created two methods of same method ...then which one is prefered ---- datatype promotion ----- typecasting 

like there are two methods of same name--- they have object and string ..then which one is called...  --- in this the object class is not called ---string is called 

in java --- object class is the main class 


line in this..there is partility --- 
like we call between StringBuffer and string --- then in this case.. the ambiquity issue will occur

comparable comparator 
natural sorting order --- ascending order 

abstraction --- hiding unncessary details -- we can acheive abstraction by using abstract class and interface 

there is no difference between function and method 

class ke bahar function --- 
class ke andar --- method 


in abstract class we can create abstract method and concrete method.. 
concrete method is the method in which we cretae the instance of the method there only 

when to use extend and when to implement it with new keywoard
