classes and object 
like vehicle is a class and car is a object 

private keywoard --- though which we can achieve data hiding 

now we are implementing data hiding 

if we want to access the element of the one file in other..then we can do it by making object 

abstract class is 

concrete method... jis method ka implementation usi method me kar de 

interface --- sirf abstract method rakh rakh skte hai--
basically --- we can declare method but not implement it// we can use it with implement keywoard 




Encapsulation 
biniding of data into one 


INHERITANCE 

in interface ---we only declare method..not implement  it ...to ambiquity issude does not arrise in java


POLYMORPHISM 



overriding --- 



Mobile mob1 = new Nokia();
mob1.camera


default private protected public
