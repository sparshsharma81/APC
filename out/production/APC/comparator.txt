comparator...

it is used to compare the two values 

it is present in java.util.package..

comparator has two functions 
equals and commpare 

public int commpareTo(Object o);   ---- this is comparator 


obj1.compareTo(obj2);

returns negative when obj1 come before obj2 
return positive when obj1 come after obj2 
returns 0 when obj is equals to obj2 


System.out.println("A".commpareTo("Z")); ---- it will return -25
System.out.println("Z".compareTo("K"))    --- it will return 15
System.out.println("Z".commpareTo("Z")) --- since the both values are equal..so it will return 0 output
